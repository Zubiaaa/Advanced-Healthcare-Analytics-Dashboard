# Advanced Healthcare Analytics Dashboard

### Background:
The HealthStat team has a powerful report that really enables an understanding of the key impacts on average LOS and cost for hospitals across the state of New York. This benchmarking will inform where targeted quality improvements can be made to both improve the hospital's operational efficiency as well as the patient experience

In the healthcare sector, enhancing operational efficiency while ensuring the delivery of high-quality patient care remains a paramount objective. In this project, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of a real-world dataset to extract insights into hospital efficiency. My analysis focused on examining the factors affecting patients' Length of Stay (LOS) and associated costs, with the aim of identifying the variables contributing to variations in hospital performance.

Utilizing my proficiency in DAX, I developed precise measures and created insightful visualizations. The culmination of my efforts was the integration of these insights into a sophisticated business dashboard, designed to effectively communicate key findings to the team.

### Problem:
I have been engaged by a consulting firm, HealthStat, to identify opportunities for enhancing hospital efficiency. The task involves analyzing a comprehensive state-wide hospital dataset. My objective is to apply my expertise in Power BI to develop an insightful and interactive dashboard that effectively communicates the findings and reveals potential areas for improving hospital performance.

### Dataset & Data Model

The dataset provided by HealthStat encompasses patient-level information on elective hip replacement surgeries conducted across the state of New York over one year. This dataset is contained in a single table comprising 30 columns. Each row corresponds to an individual inpatient stay, capturing data from admission through to discharge.

The dataset is devoid of personally identifiable health information, ensuring patient anonymity. Key attributes included in the dataset are critical for analyzing hospital efficiency, notably:

- Length of Stay: The total duration of each inpatient stay, measured in days.

- Total Costs: The expenses associated with each hospital stay.

These attributes are integral to evaluating and uncovering opportunities for improving hospital efficiency.

### Steps:

I leveraged my Power BI expertise to analyze hospital data and uncover key efficiency factors impacting length of stay and cost. Here's a glimpse into my deep dive:

1. I explored a dataset of elective hip replacement surgeries across New York, identifying significant variations in length of stay (LOS) and cost between hospitals.

2. Using DAX calculations and insightful visualizations, I pinpointed the biggest influencing factors, including patient severity, mortality risk, and discharge destination.

3. I crafted a visually captivating report for HealthStat, providing them with actionable insights to improve operational efficiency and patient experience.


### Key Insights Uncovered:

1. The average cost per discharge was $20,910, with substantial variability observed across different hospital facilities.

2. Root cause analysis revealed that several factors significantly influenced both cost and average Length of Stay (LOS). The primary determinants contributing to increased average LOS and costs include:

3. Severity of Illness: Extreme illness severity and high mortality risks were identified as having the most pronounced impact on reduced efficiency, contributing significantly to both higher costs and extended LOS.

4. Hospitals located in New York City exhibited the highest average LOS and costs compared to other regions.

5. Patient disposition to a skilled nursing facility was a notable factor affecting LOS, with implications for overall efficiency.
